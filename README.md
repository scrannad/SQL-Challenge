# SQL-Challenge

##Background
Itâ€™s been two weeks since I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, I've designed tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and queried the data to answer specific questions about the employees. This includes data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
